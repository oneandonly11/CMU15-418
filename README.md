# CMU 15-418: Parallel Computer Architecture

I am learning about parallel computer architecture in this course. The official course website is [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15418/).

This repository contains the powerpoints for the course, which are the main source of my learning.

Instead of I finished CS149 labs, I completed the CS149 labs for coding. The CS149 official website is [here](https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall24).

Thanks to the course staff for providing the course materials.

start at 2025.5.8

## labs

Here are the CS149 labs I have done so far:

- [Assignment 1: Performance Analysis on a Quad-Core CPU](https://github.com/oneandonly11/CS149-asst1)
- [Assignment 2: Building A Task Execution Library from the Ground Up](https://github.com/oneandonly11/CS149-asst2)
